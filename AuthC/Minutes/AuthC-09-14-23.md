Discussion 

1. AuthC 
    1. OAuth2 / FAPI  extension 
    2. Supports consent via openID Connect
2. AuthC is a Oauth2/FAPI extentions that supports consent via Oauth2/FAPI, OpenID Connect and OID4VP

3.Each Stakeholder see things differently

Environment - OpenID for VC Family (combo of FAPI2 & OpenID Connect) 
* FAPI looking after wallet
* OpenID - SAS + Exchange 
* if in Mobile app - Oauth2 - via API
* SAS App - OpenID Connect
* Digital Wallet - Combo of SaS & Mobile App

* Microsoft - is Org Our - (issuing and verifying and presentatio to / for wallets)

The goal of this WG is to develop OpenID specifications for the Issuer-Holder-Verifier-Model use-cases to enable issuance and presentations of the Digital Credentials of any format (IETF SD-JWTl, ISO/IEC 18013-5, etc.) and pseudonymous authentication from the End-User to the Verifier.

- VC is the model with different format of credentials
- we Define - where does consent fit in the flow of the protocol ?
- what is the extension requierd to support that flow
- what is the schema of the AuthC - credential - 
- From an ID - Perspective - Name and Address is Claim
- from Verified Credential - its a set of attribute claims to make a credential


- AuthC Credential has a # of Credentials
- VC Model = holder - verifier - issuer

"Complex equality is a theory of justice outlined by Michael Walzer in his 1983 work Spheres of Justice. It is considered innovative because of its emphasis on the broader conceptualization of distribution, which covers not only tangible goods but also abstract goods such as rights. The theory is distinguished from simple equality since it allows certain inequalities in social goods."

" theory of "complex equality", which holds that the metric of just equality is not some single material or moral good, but rather that egalitarian justice demands that each good be distributed according to its social meaning, and that no good (like money or political power) be allowed to dominate or distort the distribution of goods in other spheres;"
