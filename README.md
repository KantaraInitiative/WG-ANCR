# Kantara Initiative — ANCR Working Group (ANCR WG)

This repository contains the working materials, drafts, and versioned packages produced by the **Anchored Notice and Consent Receipt (ANCR) Working Group** under the Kantara Initiative.

ANCR WG focuses on interoperable, implementation-ready artefacts that support **inspectable, accountable notice and consent receipt exchange**.

## The Consent Receipt (core project)

The **Consent Receipt** is Kantara ANCR WG's foundational transparency artefact for co-regulated digital identification: a machine-readable record handed to a person at the point of notice, capturing who is
processing their data, for what purpose, under what legal basis, and how to exercise
their rights. It turns human consent from an unverifiable claim into inspectable evidence that scale digital trust online.

**Lineage:**

1. **Kantara Consent Receipt** — the original specification that established the
   receipt as the unit of consent evidence.
2. **ISO/IEC 29184:2020 (Annex B)** — the Consent Receipt was adopted into ISO as
   the hosted consent-receipt / consent-record reference, explicitly citing the
   Kantara Consent Receipt specification.
3. **ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023** — became the international consent record information
   structure.
4. **ANCR (Anchored Notice and Consent Receipt)** — anchors the receipt to a
   verifiable controller identity and a notice event, making the record traceable.
5. **Notice Receipt Extension (now complete)** — extends ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 into
   a receipt-exchange profile for anchored, inspectable notice evidence.

**Spec location:** [`27560-ancr-profile-extension/`](27560-ancr-profile-extension/index.md)
(current working entry point:
[`iso-27560-ts-extension/`](27560-ancr-profile-extension/iso-27560-ts-extension/index.md)).
