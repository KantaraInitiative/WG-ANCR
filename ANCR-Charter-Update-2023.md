**ANCR**   **WG**

**(2) PURPOSE:**

To provide a protocol and framework based on transparency, notice and consent that supports the use of records and receipts for decentralized authorization independent of identifier technology. To provide a set of Transparency Performance Indicators (TPIs) and an associated conformance program to establish a baseline and measurement mechanism for digital transparency, notice and consent. To further develop the initial consent receipt work with a specification for an anchor receipt for notice of purpose and context and proof of notice that supports decentralized governance and authorization (Auth C) by the principal and the controller/operator.

Collaborate with other Kantara, and community and standards groups in the adoption of the protocol and the anchor receipt.

Contribute this to ISO works, contribute to conformance programs for notice and consent in Kantara Initiative community.

Software developers, and product managers as a means of achieving interoperability across a wide range identity, security, and privacy of use cases. Developers of decentralized governance and next generation internet services.

Regulators looking for technical controls to implement legal requirements that scale.

For human beings, as the notice and consent receipts provide an alternative/complement to terms of services and privacy policies and provide something that can be understood by people. This contrasts with the current abuser experience, namely that privacy policies and terms of service address privacy concerns and provide safeguards of personal information.
