# ANCR WG → DPV (Convention 108+ legal model + evidence-first guidance)

This folder contains an ANCR Working Group contribution to the W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) ecosystem, focused on:

- A Convention 108+ legal-model extension expressed in a DPV-style pattern.
- Evidence-first requirements for notice-first transparency and digital consent governance in open-network digital identification contexts.

## What this is
- A Convention 108+ legal-model extension candidate that can be reviewed as a DPV LEGAL-style extension approach.
- Companion material that turns known gaps in DPV:27560 guidance into closeable, testable requirements (sequence integrity, notice binding, receipt availability, recipient transparency, identifier governance).

## What this is not
- Not an official W3C DPVCG deliverable.
- Not a replacement for DPV specifications, DPV primer/guides, or DPV:27560 documentation.
- Not an ISO-adopted profile. References to “ISO/IEC 27560 ‘Digital’ Consent Record Information Structure Profile” are alignment references and an implementation pattern concept used to keep evidence semantics coherent.

## Scope discipline (key rule)
These documents do not propose new interpretations of Convention 108+.
They provide:
- (1) a traceable Convention 108+ modelling structure, and
- (2) evidence-first acceptance criteria for guidance that claims to represent valid consent evidence in digital/open-network contexts.

## Present files (draft)
The following artefact is present in this folder as a draft:

- `conv108-dpv-extension-spec.md` — the Convention 108+ extension draft
  specification (namespace, legal bases, rights, principles, transparency
  requirements), plus the class-bound assurance layer (TPI v1 controller, v2
  instrument, v3 AI system). Status: **0.1 draft**, unpublished, not yet reviewed
  by Mark Lizar / ANCR-WG.

## Planned files (not yet published in this folder)
The following artefacts are in preparation and are not yet committed to this
repository. This section will list them as links once they land:

- `conv108-dpv-legal-extension-explainer.md` — the method used to derive a
  Convention 108+ DPV-style legal model and why evidence semantics are needed.
- `dpv-27560-comments.md` — comment set for DPV:27560 guidance gaps that affect
  evidence validity and interoperability.
- `dpv-27560-conformance-tests.md` — evidence-first conformance tests for DPV:27560
  guidance usage in open-network digital identification contexts.

## Intended use
- Support DPVCG evaluation and issue closure.
- Support implementer review and regulator-grade “testability” discussions.
- Provide a stable, citable package for review discussions that need to happen outside email threads and private docs.
