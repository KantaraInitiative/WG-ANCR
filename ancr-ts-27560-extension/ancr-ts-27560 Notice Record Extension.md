# ANCR Extension for ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023

Anchored Notice and Consent Receipts for operational transparency. A notice receipt profile and extension of ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023.

**Revision:** v0.5, major revision, external review draft. Supersedes v0.4 and the committed file at commit `a09559d5`.

## Foreword

This document specifies a notice receipt information structure that profiles and extends ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023, consent record information structure. It is published by the Kantara Initiative and the Anchored Notice and Consent Receipt (ANCR) Working Group as a companion specification. It is intended to be cited as prior art and as an implementation reference for SC 27/WG 5 work that depends on machine readable notice and consent records, notably contributions to ISO/IEC 27560, ISO/IEC TS 27568, ISO/IEC FDIS 27091 Annex B.4, and ISO/IEC WD 27566-2 Annex F.

**IPR note.** This ANCR record specification is required to be open. It is published under the Kantara Initiative patent and copyright terms: reciprocal royalty free, with opt out to reasonable and non discriminatory (RAND) licensing. Kantara is chartered to contribute the completed consent receipt work to ISO/IEC SC 27/WG 5.

## Introduction

Governing one's own identity digitally, with confidence in privacy, requires identifiers to be transparent and bound to a recorded artefact that can be referenced after the fact. Historically such identifiers have been encapsulated in a record and provided in receipt of an event, by context, at a time and place. A notice receipt is a container not only for identifiers, but for the integrity of the claims those identifiers represent.

A notice receipt is generated through interaction, or a lack of interaction, with a physical sign, an access point, a device, or an online notification or statement. A notice receipt can also be generated independently by the individual, from the notice, by creating or accessing a Controller Identification Record to produce proof of notice disclosure that can be exchanged between devices and across borders.

**Co-regulated digital identification.** This profile is specified for co-regulated identification. Co-regulation means one public policy with two rule sets operating on the same identifier at the same time: the controller's own rules, expressed in service terms, technical design, and internal policy; and the public rules, expressed in treaty, law, and standards. Neither self regulation nor state regulation alone governs identification at internet scale. Self regulation leaves the identifier privately defined. State regulation alone lacks operational artefacts that can be inspected at the time of interaction. This profile supplies the record structure through which the public rule set becomes machine readable, inspectable, and enforceable.

**Identity and identification are distinct.** Identity is self expression and self identification, managed by the individual. Identification is the technical and organizational process a controller uses to discover, link, or assert claims about a person. The two are governed differently: consent is a human expression managed by humans, while permissions are managed by organizations and systems. Where the two are conflated, an interface permission is presented as consent. This profile keeps them separate by requiring controller identification, and the notice bound to it, before any demand for personal identification.

**Relationship to related instruments (informative).**

## 1 Scope

This profile extends ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023, the technical specification that adopted the consent receipt specification. It specifies a machine readable online Notice Record and a corresponding Notice Receipt that together provide durable evidence of notice disclosure.

This profile specifies the record structure through which identification is co-regulated. Controller identification shall precede any demand for personal identification, and the artefacts specified in clause 7 shall be inspectable independently of any personal identifier. Where an implementation demands personal identification before a resolvable Controller Identification Record and its bound notice version are available, that implementation does not conform to this profile.

The profile supports layered and sequenced notices, notifications, and disclosures. Its requirements are lawful basis agnostic. Where the lawful basis is consent, the corresponding authorization can be represented as a specialisation of the TS 27560:2023 consent receipt.

The base extension defines a minimum interoperable set of notice artefacts for operational transparency:

- Controller Identification Record (CIR)
- Notice Record
- Notice Receipt, including the Anchored Notice Receipt classification
- Notice Event Log
- Reference integrity and version binding, through notice_id and notice_version_reference

Interaction with an online Notice Record results in a Notice Receipt, which is either:

- a full receipt, containing the required record fields, or
- a reference receipt, containing the minimum fields plus stable references and a rights payload.

NOTE: Notice, notification, disclosure, and statement sequences differ according to context.

1. In person, peer to peer, using a device, where notice and identity are physically verifiable.
2. Remote, not in person, where identity is not physically verifiable and controller identification is therefore required.

Out of scope for the base extension, and addressed by optional annexes or companion specifications:

- Authorization exchange protocol mechanics beyond the Anchored Notice Receipt
- Tokens, credentials, and wallet portability mechanisms
- Complete records of processing activity requirements
- Cross border security requirements beyond baseline notice disclosure
- AI lifecycle governance requirements beyond baseline notice disclosure

### 2.3 Verbal forms for the expression of provisions

The verbal forms used in this document are those defined in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. A requirement is expressed by "shall" and "shall not". A recommendation is expressed by "should" and "should not". Permission is expressed by "may". Possibility and capability are expressed by "can".

NOTE 1: The verbal forms are written in lower case, as they are in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. Earlier ANCR drafts, including the committed file at commit a09559d5, wrote them in upper case following the RFC 2119 convention. The meaning is unchanged, and an implementation conforming to an earlier draft is not affected by the change of case.

NOTE 2: This document does not use "must" to express a requirement. Where "must" appears in explanatory text it carries no normative weight.

## 3 Terms and definitions

Terms and definitions given in ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 and ISO/IEC 29100 apply, together with the following.

### 3.1 Controller Identification Record

Publicly accessible controller accountability record, used as the anchor for notice and receipt generation.

### 3.2 Notice Record

Versioned, controller maintained record of notice content.

### 3.3 Notice Receipt

Bilateral evidence artefact recording that a specific notice version was disclosed or presented to an individual at a stated time.

### 3.4 Anchored Notice Receipt

Classification of Notice Receipt applied to the first Notice Receipt issued for a given notice version disclosure event.

Note 1 to entry: Where the lawful basis is consent, the Anchored Notice Receipt carries the proof of notice disclosure on which valid consent depends, and subsequent authorization receipts link back to it.

Note 2 to entry: The classification is carried by the anchored_notice_receipt field and the anchored_notice_receipt_id linkage field, see 7.3.

### 3.5 Notice Event Log

Append only record of lifecycle events relating to notices and receipts, including, at minimum, issuance and material change, with optional hooks for withdrawal and objection events.

Note 1 to entry: The minimum event types are stated in 7.4.1, and the hooks for withdrawal, objection, and rights exercise are recommended in 7.4.3.

### 3.6 notice_version_reference

Immutable reference to the notice version in effect at the time of disclosure.

Note 1 to entry: The reference resolves to a Notice Version Object, 3.24, which carries the integrity hash and the publication time of that version, see 7.2.4.

### 3.7 transparency statement

Versioned disclosure artefact expressing the standing terms of notice, including controller identification, processing context, and rights mechanisms, suitable for audit and stable referencing.

Note 1 to entry: In this profile the transparency statement is realised as the Notice Record, see 7.2.

### 3.8 transparency notification

Event bound message signalling that a transparency relevant event has occurred, for example issuance, material change, or a rights lifecycle event.

Note 1 to entry: In this profile the transparency notification is realised as a Notice Event Log entry, optionally accompanied by a receipt carrying notice_type = notification, see 7.4.

### 3.9 reciprocal and proportionate transparency

Disclosure property in which the processing capabilities of the technology in use, and the practical rights controls available to the individual, are stated so that what the technology can do is matched by what the individual can see and control.

### 3.10 co-regulated identification

Use of digital identification mechanisms under two concurrent rule sets, the controller's own rules and the applicable public rules of treaty, law, and standards, implemented so that the public rules are expressed as inspectable record structure and are verifiable before identification occurs.

Note 1 to entry: Co-regulated identification does not restrict which identification technology is used. It constrains the sequence and the evidence: accountable controller identification, machine readable notice, and a durable receipt precede personal identification.

Note 2 to entry: Conformance is assessed through the artefacts in clause 7, not through claims made in prose policy documents.

### 3.11 identification

Technical and organizational process by which a controller recognises, links, or asserts claims about an individual, including the assignment or inference of identifiers.

### 3.12 identity

Self expression and self identification managed by the individual, including the individual's own choice of which identifiers to bind to a given Controller Identification Record.

### 3.13 minimum notice disclosure

Smallest set of disclosures that is present, resolvable, and inspectable before identification or processing begins, comprising the Controller Identification Record, the notice version in effect, the asserted lawful basis, the scope of disclosure, and the privacy access point.

Note 1 to entry: The requirement to make this set available is stated in 7.2.3 and tested by criterion C2 in 5.1.

### 3.14 anonymity by default

Property whereby notice disclosure and the resulting evidence artefacts are generable, retrievable, and verifiable without identification of the individual, and without an account_id or a pii_principal_id.

Note 1 to entry: Anonymity by default applies to the notice and evidence layer. It does not restrict identification required by the lawful basis for the processing itself.

Note 2 to entry: Retrieval of a Controller Identification Record is not an identification event, see 7.1.

### 3.15 non-exclusion

Property whereby the minimum notice disclosure and the routes to recourse are reachable through at least one privacy_access_point modality that does not require the individual to hold, present, or authenticate a digital identification credential.

Note 1 to entry: Non-exclusion addresses accessibility needs, low or absent connectivity, delegated and assisted interaction, and in person contexts where notice and identity are physically verifiable.

### 3.16 notice

Disclosure made before processing, authorization, identification, or consent.

### 3.17 online notice

Notice presented, published, or made inspectable in an online environment.

### 3.18 digital transparency

Online notice made machine readable, versioned, inspectable, evidenced, and receipted.

### 3.19 consent

Freely given, specific and informed agreement of the PII principal to the processing of their PII.

[SOURCE: ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023, 3.1]

Note 1 to entry: This document does not redefine consent. The term is imported unchanged from ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023. In operational terms this document describes consent as human managed legal authorization given after sufficient notice and meaningful choice, which is a description of how the imported definition is realised through the artefacts in clause 7, not a substitute for it. The term this document adds is online consent, 3.20.

Note 2 to entry: Where consent is the lawful basis, consent references the prior notice disclosure event on which it depends, as specified in 7.6.

Note 3 to entry: A construction in which offline consent, where the identity and the location of the individual are assumed rather than recorded, is presented through an online interface is not online consent as defined in 3.20. Such a construction is governed by the applicable data protection regulation, see 7.2.2.

### 3.20 online consent

Consent expressed online, where notice, choice, action, and the resulting evidence are represented by machine readable records of the interaction.

Note 1 to entry: Online consent is the mechanism through which the individual controls processing of their own data online. Identity and location are recorded through the notice artefacts rather than assumed.

Note 2 to entry: Online consent is the default interpretive context for digital identification, see 7.2.2.

### 3.21 permission

Technical allow or deny control.

Note 1 to entry: Permission is not consent. Where an interface permission is presented as consent, the two are conflated.

### 3.22 consent record

Controller retained evidence of consent, derived from a consent statement and linked to notice evidence where consent is the lawful basis.

Note 1 to entry: The term is imported from ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023, 3.3. This document does not redefine it, and adds only the offline and online distinction stated in Note 2.

Note 2 to entry: An offline consent record and an online consent record are distinct artefacts and are named distinctly, as required by 7.2.2. An offline consent record assumes the identity and the location of the individual and is held privately in the controller's record of processing activities. An online consent record records the notice version, the time of disclosure, and the authorization state, and is bilateral.

### 3.23 two factor online notice

Notice event in which presentation controls and evidence receipt generation are both present.

Note 1 to entry: The two factors are counted within one notice event. Two factor online notice is not an assurance level. It does not denote a repeated notice, a round in a notification sequence, or a second presentation of the notice, which is the pattern commonly described as prompt fatigue. It denotes proof of the same notice event.

Note 2 to entry: The pre-authorization disclosure baseline in this document is expressed by minimum notice disclosure, 3.13, and anonymity by default, 3.14, not by a factor label. Adjacent usage of factor labels is described in the NOTE in 6.1.

### 3.24 Notice Version Object

Structured object representing one version of a Notice Record, comprising the location at which the version is retrievable, the version identifier, the integrity hash of the notice content as published, and the time of publication.

Note 1 to entry: The Notice Version Object is the object that notice_version_reference resolves to. Its field set and the verification procedure applied to it are specified in 7.2.4.

Note 2 to entry: The object carries the integrity claim. Without a published hash and a publication time, a version reference is indistinguishable from a pointer to a mutable resource.

### 3.25 Authorization State Object

Structured object representing the authorization state relied upon for a processing context at a stated time, comprising the state of authorization for each disclosed purpose and the validity state of the record that carries it.

Note 1 to entry: One object carries both states. Per purpose authorization state and record validity are properties of the same object, and an implementation does not maintain them as two objects, see 7.2.5.

Note 2 to entry: The object applies under any lawful basis. Where the lawful basis is consent, it carries the consent authorization state, and it is the object referred to in 7.2.2 as dynamic active state based authorization.

Note 3 to entry: The field set, the state vocabularies, and the reconstruction procedure are specified in 7.2.5.

## 5 Conformance

An implementation conforms to the base extension if it satisfies every mandatory requirement in clause 8. An implementation may additionally claim conformance to the optional profiles defined in Annex B, that is profile B1, PII processing record structure, and profile B2, personal processing record structure.

**Relationship to conformance with ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023.** This document is an extension of ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 and is not a stand alone specification. An implementation that conforms to this document conforms to ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 for the record content it carries, subject to the single declared deviation in A.0, which relaxes the requirement for pii_principal_id. A controller that requires conformance to ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 without that deviation shall populate a principal identifier in the controller held record as described in A.0, while keeping the individual side Anchored Notice Receipt free of it.

Conformance to ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 alone does not constitute conformance to this document, because clause 7 specifies artefacts that the technical specification does not: the Controller Identification Record, the Notice Version Object, the Authorization State Object, and the Notice Event Log.

### 5.1 Co-regulation conformance criteria

An implementation claiming conformance to co-regulated identification shall satisfy all of the following.

- **C1 Sequence.** A resolvable Controller Identification Record is available before any demand for personal identification.
- **C2 Minimum notice disclosure.** The elements described in 3.13 are resolvable at the time of the disclosure event.
- **C3 Anonymity by default.** The Anchored Notice Receipt is generable and verifiable without an account_id or a pii_principal_id.
- **C4 Public rule reference.** The Notice Record states the applicable public rule set by reference to the code of conduct, code of practice, or legal instrument relied upon.
- **C5 Evidence.** A Notice Event Log entry exists for issuance and for each material change, and each receipt binds to an immutable notice_version_reference that resolves to a Notice Version Object whose notice_hash matches the notice content retrieved at the time of assessment, see 7.2.4.
- **C6 Reciprocal and proportionate disclosure.** The disclosure set in 7.2.1 is published and bound to the notice version in effect.
- **C7 Non-exclusion.** At least one privacy_access_point modality is operable without the individual holding, presenting, or authenticating a digital identification credential, and the minimum notice disclosure is retrievable through that modality.
- **C8 Authorization state.** Where authorization state is relied upon for the processing context, a single Authorization State Object exists as specified in 7.2.5, each state change is recorded in the Notice Event Log against the same notice_id and notice_version_reference, and the state applying at a stated past time is reconstructable from the record.

An implementation that satisfies C1 to C8 for a given notice version may assert co-regulated identification conformance for the processing context covered by that version. Conformance is asserted per notice version, not per organization.

## 6 Overview of notice artefacts and reference integrity

### 6.1 Two factor online notice and receipt evidence

This profile supports a two factor online notice pattern (2FN) for establishing durable evidence of notice disclosure and, where applicable, of consent.

- **Factor 1, presentation controls.** The notice is presented using ISO/IEC 29184 aligned presentation controls, for example layered presentation, timing, and interaction patterns, reusable across notice types.
- **Factor 2, evidence receipt.** A Notice Receipt is generated as durable evidence that a specific notice version was presented or available at a specific time. Where the lawful basis is consent, the receipt supports proof of informed consent by binding the authorization state to the disclosed notice version.

Implementations should treat 2FN as an interoperability pattern. The presentation controls establish a consistent experience and meaningful choice. The receipt provides verifiable, referenceable evidence for audit, later inquiry, and dispute resolution.

**Lineage note (informative).** The two factor online notice pattern originates in the Minimum Viable Consent Receipt, the specification from which the ANCR co-regulation perspective developed. In that lineage, 2FN denotes the mode in which the PII Principal initiates the interaction: the individual approaches a physical sign, an access point, a device, or an online notice, the notice is presented, and a bilateral receipt is returned. The two factors are counted within a single notice event, presentation and evidence. They are not two rounds of a sequence, and 2FN does not denote a second presentation of the notice.

**Initiation modes.** A notice disclosure event is either principal initiated, where the individual seeks the notice in order to discover, or controller initiated, where the controller presents the notice in the course of offering or operating a service. Both modes produce the same artefact set specified in 6.2, and the requirements of this profile apply to both without variation. The initiation mode affects only the operational interpretation of the disclosure event, as specified in 7.2.2.

NOTE: Where this profile is read alongside work items that use one factor notice and two factor notice to denote rounds in a disclosure and authorization sequence, the two usages count different things. The equivalent here of a controller side pre-authorization disclosure minimum is the minimum notice disclosure in 3.13, together with the anonymity by default requirements in 3.14, 7.3.1, and criterion C3.

### 6.2 The notice artefact set

1. Controller Identification Record, the accountability anchor
2. Notice Record, the versioned notice content
3. Notice Receipt, including the Anchored Notice Receipt classification, the disclosure evidence
4. Notice Event Log, the lifecycle evidence

Together these four artefacts constitute the co-regulation evidence set. The CIR anchors public accountability. The Notice Record expresses the public rule set in operational form. The Anchored Notice Receipt evidences the disclosure event bilaterally. The Notice Event Log evidences the lifecycle. Two factor online notice is the mechanism by which the set is produced: presentation controls establish meaningful choice, and the receipt makes that choice inspectable after the fact.

### 6.3 Reference integrity and version binding

A Notice Receipt shall reference:

- notice_id, the stable family identifier
- notice_version_reference, the immutable version reference

A material change to a notice, including a change to purposes, lawful basis, recipients or jurisdictions, retention, or rights mechanisms, shall:

- create a new notice version, represented by a new Notice Version Object with a new notice_hash and a new published_at, see 7.2.4, and
- create a corresponding Notice Event Log entry.

Historic notice versions shall be retained for as long as any processing or record depends on them.

## 7 Notice record specifications

### 7.1 Controller Identification Record

The CIR is the public rule anchor for co-regulated identification. The CIR shall be resolvable before any demand for personal identification, shall be retrievable without authentication, and shall not require the individual to identify in order to retrieve it. Retrieval of a CIR shall not be recorded as an identification event.

#### 7.1.1 CIR minimum field set

A CIR shall include at minimum:

- controller_identification_record_id
- controller_public_id_uri
- controller_name
- jurisdiction
- privacy_access_point, structured

A CIR should include:

- controller_address
- code_of_conduct, where applicable
- notice_event_log_url

A CIR may include:

- derogation_reference, for lawful withholding

NOTE: The identifier field is named controller_identification_record_id. Earlier drafts, including the committed file at commit a09559d5, used controller_identity_record_id. Implementations should treat controller_identity_record_id as deprecated, should accept it on input for one revision cycle, and shall emit controller_identification_record_id. The rename reflects that the record anchors identification carried out by a controller, and does not describe the identity of an individual.

#### 7.1.2 CIR field specification table (normative)

| Field | Description | Required | Value type | Constraints | Exposure | TS 27560:2023 anchor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| controller_identification_record_id | Stable identifier for the CIR | Yes | URI or string identifier | The value shall be stable and suitable for reference by receipts and event log entries | Public | 6.3.6.2 party_id, controller party |
| controller_public_id_uri | Public resolvable controller identifier | Yes | URI | The value shall be resolvable or dereferenceable by intended relying parties | Public | 6.3.6.5 party_url, closest anchor |
| controller_name | Controller legal name | Yes | String | The value shall represent the accountable controller entity | Public | 6.3.6.7 party_name |
| jurisdiction | Applicable jurisdiction indicator or pointer | Yes | Code or string | The value shall be present, and may point to a code of conduct reference | Public | 6.3.4.17 jurisdiction, PII processing |
| privacy_access_point | Rights and contact access modalities | Yes | Array of objects | Each entry shall include type, value, and label | Public | 6.3.6.9 party_contact, closest anchor |
| notice_event_log_url | Pointer to the notice event log service or resource | No | URI | When present, should be publicly discoverable | Public | Extension field |
| controller_address | Controller address | No | String or structured address | No additional constraint | Public | 6.3.6.3 party_address, closest anchor |
| code_of_conduct | Pointer to the authoritative code of conduct or code of practice | No | URI | When present, should be versioned | Public | 6.3.4.21 codes_of_conduct, closest anchor |
| derogation_reference | Lawful withholding or derogation metadata | No | Object | When present, should include reference_uri, authority, and valid_until | Public or Restricted | Extension field |

#### 7.1.3 privacy_access_point

privacy_access_point shall support multiple modalities. Each modality entry shall include type, value, and label.

At least one modality shall be operable without the individual holding, presenting, or authenticating a digital identification credential, and shall provide access to the minimum notice disclosure described in 3.13. Where the controller's context includes in person, assisted, or offline interaction, the modality set should include a non digital or assisted channel. An implementation that provides recourse only through an authenticated digital channel does not satisfy non-exclusion, see 3.15 and criterion C7.

#### 7.1.4 derogation_reference

Where lawful derogations apply, derogation_reference should include reference_uri, authority, and valid_until.

### 7.2 Notice Record

A Notice Record shall be versioned and resolvable, so that a Notice Receipt can reference an immutable version.

The Notice Record is the machine readable transparency statement defined in 3.7. A notification about issuance or change is the transparency notification defined in 3.8, and is represented as a Notice Event Log entry, optionally accompanied by a receipt carrying notice_type = notification, referencing the relevant notice_version_reference.

#### 7.2.1 Reciprocal and proportionate transparency disclosure set

For each Notice Record version relied upon by a receipt, the controller shall publish a technology and controls disclosure set that is:

- bound to the exact notice_version_reference in effect at the time of disclosure, and
- publicly retrievable, either inline in the Notice Record or by stable reference.

The disclosure set shall include at minimum:

- technology_in_use
- controls_available_primary
- associated_or_derivative_controls, where applicable
- secondary_purposes_of_use, where present
- limitations_or_derogations_on_controls, where applicable

The Notice Record shall include a stable pointer to the disclosure set using transparency_disclosure_reference, unless the full disclosure set is embedded inline in the Notice Record.

A change to the disclosure set that affects the technology classes in use, the availability, scope, or effect of practical rights controls, or the secondary purposes, shall be treated as a material change, and shall trigger a new notice version and a corresponding Notice Event Log entry, see 6.3 and 7.4.

**Co-regulation test.** The disclosure set is the measurable test of co-regulation. Where the capability of the technology in use exceeds the controls disclosed as available to the individual, the disclosure is not proportionate, and the identification is not co-regulated for that notice version. Implementations shall state limitations and derogations on controls explicitly rather than omitting them, so that any shortfall is inspectable rather than concealed.

#### 7.2.2 Lawful basis interoperability

This profile is lawful basis interoperable. The Notice Receipt structure shall support every lawful basis available under applicable law. Each lawful basis carries distinct rights, obligations, and dispute triggers.

Implementations shall state the asserted lawful basis in the receipt header, and shall publish the applicable rights and obligations variant using the Annex C table structure.

**Disclosure evidence and authorization evidence are separate.** The lawful_basis value records the basis asserted by the controller at the time the notice version was presented. It shall not be interpreted as evidence that the asserted basis was validly established.

**Online consent is the default context for digital identification.** Where the notice is an online notice presented in a digital identification context, the individual initiates the interaction in order to discover, and the interaction is a two factor online notice returning a bilateral Anchored Notice Receipt, the default interpretation of the disclosure event is online consent as defined in 3.20, unless another lawful basis is explicitly asserted in the receipt header.

The default provides for operational transparency, accommodating dynamic active state based consent authorization online, and multiple concurrent lawful bases. The authorization state is active rather than static: it can be given, altered, restricted, objected to, or withdrawn by the individual after the disclosure event, and each change shall be recorded against the same notice_id and notice_version_reference so that the state at any point in time is reconstructable. The object that carries that state is the Authorization State Object specified in 7.2.5. Where more than one lawful basis applies to the processing context covered by a notice version, each basis shall be stated and referenced to its Annex C row, and the default in this subclause applies only to the online consent component.

The basis for the default is the discovery act. An individual who seeks out and reads a public notice does so in order to discover the terms of the interaction, and online consent is implied operationally in that act unless the individual is notified otherwise. The established analogue is the physical sign: absent a sign, approach and looking are ordinarily permitted, and the sign is the mechanism that notifies otherwise. The controller carries the burden of notification, and silence on the part of the controller is not the assertion of another basis.

**Offline consent presented online is outside the default.** Where the interaction presents an offline consent construction through an online interface, that is a construction in which the identity and the location of the individual are assumed rather than recorded, the default in this subclause shall not apply. In that case the lawful basis shall be asserted explicitly in the receipt header, and it shall be evidenced by an authorization record distinct from the Anchored Notice Receipt, captured in a PII Controller held record of processing activities that is private and not accessible by default. Such a construction is governed by the applicable data protection regulation and is a controller held compliance artefact. Online consent, by contrast, is the mechanism through which the individual controls processing of their own data online, and it is recorded rather than assumed.

**Offline and online artefacts are named distinctly.** Implementations shall distinguish, in naming and in reference, between an offline notice record and an offline consent record on the one hand, and an online notice record and an online consent record on the other. An offline artefact assumes the identity and the location of the individual and is held privately by the controller in its record of processing activities. An online artefact records identification, notice version, and time of disclosure, and is bilateral. The two shall not be exchanged, mapped, or reported as equivalent artefacts, and a receipt shall not reference an offline consent record as evidence of online consent.

NOTE: The distinction is what allows a relying party to tell whether the evidence in hand was recorded or assumed. Where the two are named identically, an offline construction presented through an online interface becomes indistinguishable from online consent at the point of inspection, which is the conflation this profile exists to prevent.

**Scope limit on the default.** The default is an interpretation of the notice disclosure event only. It is not evidence of legal consent for processing, and it does not substitute for an authorization artefact where the lawful basis or the jurisdiction requires one. It does not apply to controller initiated disclosure. No lawful basis other than online consent is inferred from the presence of a receipt.

NOTE: A dedicated initiation indicator may be specified in a future revision so that principal initiation is recorded independently of the 2FN classification. Until then, implementations relying on the default should record the initiation mode in the disclosure set for the applicable notice version.

Where the asserted lawful basis is consent, conformance should additionally require an authorization record that is distinct from the Anchored Notice Receipt and separately bound to the same notice_id and notice_version_reference. The receipt records disclosure. The authorization record records permission. Where a secondary purpose relies on consent, that authorization shall be expressed as a separate authorization receipt bound to the Anchored Notice Receipt, see Annex D.2.

Where the disclosure event is outside the default described above, no authorization record exists, and no basis other than consent is asserted, the exchange shall be recorded with the lawful basis unresolved, using the value defined in Annex C. Outside that default, an unresolved lawful basis shall not be defaulted to consent.

NOTE: Separating disclosure evidence from authorization evidence keeps the notice record usable under every basis in Annex C, and prevents a transparency artefact from being read as a permission artefact.

**Decision record.** The scoped default in this subclause supersedes the flat no-inference rule carried in the committed file at commit a09559d5. The distinction that governs is the consent construction in use, not the presence of a receipt: online consent for digital identification is recorded and defaults as stated above, while offline consent presented online assumes identity and location and therefore carries no default. Jurisdictions that reject an interpretive default for the online case shall profile this subclause explicitly and record the profiling rule with the notice version.

Where a lawful basis other than consent is asserted, the receipt header shall state that basis explicitly, for example contract, legal obligation, legitimate interest, vital interest, or public interest, and shall reference the corresponding Annex C row.

Receipts are designed to be detectable and reusable, so that repetitive notice prompts and repetitive consent prompts are reduced and prompt fatigue is mitigated. The profile complements existing physical signs and privacy policy pages by providing a standardized notice record that can be extended by context and by external codes of conduct, in support of transparency by default codes of practice.

By standardizing notice version references and receipt exchange, the profile supports cross border transparency and dispute resolution, including material change signalling through the Notice Event Log.

Co-regulation applies across all lawful bases, not only consent. Where the lawful basis is consent, the Anchored Notice Receipt provides the proof of notice disclosure on which valid consent depends. Where the lawful basis is contract, legal obligation, legitimate interest, vital interest, or public interest, the same artefacts evidence that the public rule set was disclosed and that the individual could inspect authority, purpose, and justification before identification. The evidence obligation does not vary with the lawful basis. Only the rights and objection mechanisms vary, as set out in Annex C.

#### 7.2.3 Availability of the minimum notice disclosure

The elements described in 3.13 shall be present, resolvable, and inspectable before identification or processing begins, and shall be retrievable through at least one modality that satisfies 7.1.3. This requirement is tested by criterion C2.

#### 7.2.4 Notice Version Object and verification

Each notice version shall be represented by a Notice Version Object (NVO), as defined in 3.24.

An NVO shall include:

- notice_url, the location at which that notice version is retrievable
- notice_version_id, the version identifier
- notice_hash, the integrity hash of the notice content as published, computed with SHA-256 or with an equivalent or stronger algorithm
- published_at, the time at which that notice version was published

An NVO should include:

- hash_algorithm, where an algorithm other than SHA-256 is used
- controller_identification_record_id, the controller accountable for the version
- supersedes, the notice_version_id of the version replaced

notice_version_reference shall resolve to the applicable NVO. Where resolution is not available to the relying party, notice_version_reference shall carry notice_version_id and notice_hash directly.

A material change shall create a new NVO, with a new notice_version_id, a new notice_hash, and a new published_at, and shall not alter an existing NVO. Historic NVOs shall be retained for as long as any receipt, processing record, or event log entry references them.

**Verification procedure (normative).** A relying party verifies a disclosure claim as follows.

1. Retrieve the notice version using notice_url from the NVO referenced by the receipt.
2. Compute the hash of the retrieved content using the stated algorithm.
3. Compare the computed value with notice_hash. Where the values differ, the notice version shall be treated as unverified, and the receipt shall not be relied upon as evidence of the content disclosed.
4. Where an anchor record, a controller signature, or a notary proof is present, verify it over the same hash inputs.

NOTE: Immutability under 6.3 and criterion C5 are testable only where the hash and the publication time are published. The NVO makes the integrity claim inspectable rather than asserted, and allows a relying party to detect a notice version that was altered after disclosure.

#### 7.2.5 Authorization State Object and state reconstruction

Where authorization state is relied upon for a processing context, that state shall be represented by an Authorization State Object (ASO), as defined in 3.25. The ASO carries both the per purpose authorization state and the validity state of the record. An implementation shall not maintain separate objects for the two states, and shall not express record validity independently of the purpose state formed against the same notice version.

An ASO shall include:

- authorization_state_id, the identifier of this state instance
- controller_identification_record_id, the accountable controller
- notice_id and notice_version_reference, the notice version the state was formed against
- purpose_state, an array in which each entry states the purpose reference, the lawful_basis relied upon for that purpose, the state value, and the state_time
- record_validity, the validity state of the record
- state_time, the time at which this state instance was formed

An ASO should include:

- anchored_notice_receipt_id, the disclosure event the state is anchored to
- supersedes, the authorization_state_id of the instance replaced
- state_source, whether the change was initiated by the individual, by the controller, or by expiry
- evaluated_at, where a relying party records the time of evaluation

An ASO may include:

- expires_at, where the state is time limited
- derogation_reference, where validity is suspended under a stated lawful derogation

**purpose_state vocabulary (normative).** Each purpose_state entry shall take one of the following values: not_given, given, altered, restricted, objected, withdrawn, expired.

**record_validity vocabulary (normative).** record_validity shall take one of the following values: valid, invalid, suspended.

A change to any state value shall create a new ASO instance carrying supersedes, and shall not alter an existing instance. Each change shall create a Notice Event Log entry of type authorization_state_changed or record_validity_changed, bound to the same notice_id and notice_version_reference, see 7.4.1. Historic ASO instances shall be retained for as long as any processing record depends on them.

A material change to the notice shall not alter an existing ASO instance. Where state is carried forward to a new notice version, a new ASO instance shall be created referencing the new notice_version_reference, so that the notice version each state was formed against remains inspectable.

An ASO shall not require an account_id or a pii_principal_id, in accordance with 3.14 and 7.3.1. Its exposure is bilateral, as defined in 7.3.2.

**Reconstruction procedure (normative).** A relying party establishes the state applying at a time T as follows.

1. Retrieve the ASO instances for the applicable notice_id, and order them by state_time using supersedes.
2. Select the instance in effect at T, and cross check it against the authorization_state_changed and record_validity_changed entries in the Notice Event Log for the same period.
3. Evaluate record_validity as at T. Where it is invalid or suspended at T, the purpose_state values shall not be relied upon as authorization for that period.
4. Evaluate the purpose_state entry for the purpose in question as at T.
5. Verify the notice version the instance references using the procedure in 7.2.4. Where the notice version is unverified, the state shall be treated as unverified for evidential purposes.

NOTE: The ASO is the authorization side counterpart of the Notice Version Object. Without it, 7.2.2 requires state to be reconstructable while nothing in the record structure carries the state, and a relying party evaluating a receipt issued in the past cannot tell whether the authorization it references still stands. Specifying one object rather than a consent object and a separate record validity flag prevents two state models that can disagree. The DPV style companion expresses this object rather than proposing its own state property.

### 7.3 Notice Receipt and the Anchored Notice Receipt classification

A Notice Receipt is the artefact defined in 3.3. The Anchored Notice Receipt is a classification applied to the first Notice Receipt issued for a given notice version disclosure event, as defined in 3.4. The classification is asserted using the anchored_notice_receipt field.

Where anchored_notice_receipt is absent or false, the receipt shall link to the applicable Anchored Notice Receipt using anchored_notice_receipt_id, so that subsequent receipts remain traceable to the initial notice disclosure event.

#### 7.3.1 Anonymity by default

An Anchored Notice Receipt shall not require an account_id or a pii_principal_id.

Generation, retention, and verification of an Anchored Notice Receipt shall be possible without identification of the individual. Where an implementation offers receipt verification, that verification shall not require the individual to authenticate or to present a digital identification credential. Anonymity by default applies to the notice and evidence layer and does not restrict identification required by the lawful basis for the processing itself.

#### 7.3.2 Notice Receipt field specification table (normative)

At minimum, an Anchored Notice Receipt shall include schema_version, receipt_id, notice_id, notice_version_reference, controller_identification_record_id or a resolvable pointer to the CIR, presented_at, lawful_basis, purpose, and notice_type.

**Exposure values used in this document.**

- **Public.** The value is published and retrievable by any party without authentication.
- **Bilateral.** The value is held by both the issuing controller and the receiving individual, and is not required to be published.
- **Restricted.** The value is withheld from publication under a stated lawful derogation and is disclosed only to an authorised party.

| Field | Description | Required | Value type | Constraints | Exposure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| schema_version | Schema reference for technical interpretation of the receipt structure | Yes | String identifier | The value shall reference the receipt schema in effect at issuance, using the identifier and the version rule in 7.3.4 | Bilateral |
| anchored_notice_receipt | Indicator that this receipt instance is the Anchored Notice Receipt for the applicable notice version disclosure event | No | Boolean | When true, the receipt is classified as an Anchored Notice Receipt; when false or absent, the receipt shall reference the applicable Anchored Notice Receipt using anchored_notice_receipt_id | Bilateral |
| receipt_id | Receipt instance identifier | Yes | URI or string identifier | The value shall be unique within the issuer domain, or as defined by the implementation | Bilateral |
| anchored_notice_receipt_id | Reference to the applicable Anchored Notice Receipt instance | No | URI or string identifier | When anchored_notice_receipt is true, this field should be absent or equal to receipt_id; otherwise it shall reference the applicable Anchored Notice Receipt | Bilateral |
| account_id | Identifier or reference for the account or relationship context, pseudonymous where applicable | No | URI or string identifier | When present, should be unlinkable and data minimizing; shall not be required for anonymous operation | Bilateral |
| notice_id | Stable notice family identifier | Yes | URI or string identifier | The value shall remain stable across notice versions | Public |
| notice_version_reference | Immutable reference to the disclosed notice version | Yes | URI or hash reference | The value shall reference the exact notice version in effect at the time of disclosure, and shall resolve to the applicable Notice Version Object, see 7.2.4 | Public |
| notice_version_hash | Integrity hash of the notice version disclosed | No | Hash string | The value should be present where the receipt is verified without resolving the Notice Version Object; where present, it shall equal notice_hash in the applicable NVO, see 7.2.4 | Public |
| transparency_disclosure_reference | Stable pointer to the technology and controls disclosure set of the Notice Record | No | URI | Where the disclosure set is not embedded inline in the Notice Record, this field should be present so that relying parties can retrieve the 7.2.1 elements bound to notice_version_reference | Public |
| controller_identification_record_id | Reference to the CIR | Yes | URI or string identifier | The value shall reference a resolvable CIR | Public |
| presented_at | Time of disclosure or presentation | Yes | Date and time | The value shall be recorded using the date and time format specified in the ISO 8601 series, in the UTC time zone | Bilateral |
| lawful_basis | Asserted lawful basis for the processing context covered by the notice version | Yes | Controlled vocabulary | The value shall use the vocabulary in Annex C, and shall be present in the receipt header | Public |
| purpose | Recorded purpose relied upon for the processing context | Yes | Text or structured reference | The value shall be bound to notice_version_reference and controller_identification_record_id, and may be carried by reference to the Notice Record for the applicable version, see 7.5 | Public |
| two_factor_notice | Indicates that the disclosure event was a two factor online notice producing a bilateral receipt | No | Boolean | Where true in an online digital identification context and no other basis is asserted, the disclosure event is by default interpreted as online consent under 7.2.2; outside that context the field records presentation and acknowledgement only | Bilateral |
| notice_type | Notice classification | Yes | Controlled vocabulary | The value shall use the vocabulary in 7.3.3 | Public |
| recipient_jurisdictions | Destination jurisdictions for cross border transfer or disclosure | Conditional | Array of country codes | Where cross border transfer or disclosure applies, this field shall be present; values should use ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 | Public |
| transfer_mechanism | Transfer mechanism or safeguard class | Conditional | Controlled vocabulary | Where cross border transfer or disclosure applies, this field shall be present; the vocabulary may be profiled by jurisdiction | Public |
| surveillance_risks | Material risk disclosure for state access and surveillance exposure | No | Text or structured reference | Where applicable, should be present; where present, shall be version bound through notice_version_reference | Public |
| rights_derogations | Disclosure of rights limitations or derogations in the applicable context | No | Text or structured reference | Where applicable, should be present; a change shall be treated as a material change | Public |

#### 7.3.3 notice_type vocabulary (normative)

notice_type shall take one of the following values:

- statement
- notification
- risk_disclosure
- policy
- signal

Implementations may define additional notice types, but shall map each of them to one of the values above for interoperability.

#### 7.3.4 schema_version identifier and version rule (normative)

The schema identified by this revision is `ancr-notice-receipt-2.0`. An implementation conforming to this revision shall emit `schema_version` with that value.

The version identifier follows a major, minor, patch rule.

- The **major** component shall be incremented where a change breaks an implementation built on the previous version, including the removal or rename of a field, a change to whether a field is required, and a change to the default interpretation of a disclosure event.
- The **minor** component shall be incremented where a field, an event type, or a vocabulary value is added without invalidating a record produced under the previous version.
- The **patch** component shall be incremented for editorial change that does not alter the record structure.

This revision carries the major component 2 because four changes break an implementation built on the file published at commit a09559d5, which carried no stated schema version value.

1. `controller_identity_record_id` is renamed to `controller_identification_record_id`, see 7.1.1.
2. Each notice version shall be represented by a Notice Version Object carrying `notice_hash` and `published_at`, see 7.2.4, and criterion C5 and mandatory requirement 3 now test it.
3. The flat rule that no lawful basis is inferred from a receipt is replaced by the scoped default in 7.2.2, which changes how a receipt issued in an online digital identification context is interpreted.
4. Where authorization state is relied upon, it shall be carried by an Authorization State Object, see 7.2.5, tested by criterion C8 and mandatory requirement 11.

A relying party that encounters a receipt with an absent `schema_version`, or with a value carrying a major component below 2, shall interpret the record against the file published at commit a09559d5, and shall not apply the default in 7.2.2 to it.

NOTE: A receipt issued under `ancr-notice-receipt-2.0` is not interchangeable with one issued under an earlier draft, because the same field name can carry a different interpretation of the disclosure event. Stating the schema version in the receipt header is what allows a relying party to detect that difference rather than infer it.

### 7.4 Notice Event Log

#### 7.4.1 Minimum event types

The Notice Event Log shall support at minimum:

- notice_issued
- notice_material_change

Where an Authorization State Object is maintained under 7.2.5, the Notice Event Log shall additionally support:

- authorization_state_changed
- record_validity_changed

The Notice Event Log should additionally support:

- cir_updated, for a change to the Controller Identification Record relied upon by a notice version
- disclosure_set_updated, for a change to the disclosure set in 7.2.1

#### 7.4.2 Event record minimum fields (normative)

Each Notice Event Log entry shall include at minimum:

- event_id
- event_time
- event_type
- notice_id, notice_version_reference, or both
- receipt_id, where applicable

#### 7.4.3 Event type registry (normative)

Implementations shall support at minimum the following event types. Additional event types may be defined by companion specifications.

| event_type | Trigger | Required linkages | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| notice_issued | Issuance or publication of a new notice version | The entry shall include notice_version_reference, and should include notice_id | Supports discovery of current and historic notice versions |
| notice_material_change | Any material change, including purposes, lawful basis, recipients or jurisdictions, retention, and rights mechanisms | The entry shall include the prior and the new notice_version_reference, or an implementation defined diff pointer | Enforces version binding and ongoing reference discipline |

The Notice Event Log should support hooks for:

- withdrawal and objection events
- rights exercise events

NOTE: Implementations may tier event log requirements by assurance level. Where tiered, the implementation shall state the tier.

**Co-regulation note.** The Notice Event Log is the lifecycle evidence for co-regulated identification. Where an implementation asserts conformance under 5.1, the log shall evidence the notice versions relied upon for that assertion, so that a co-regulation claim can be checked against a point in time rather than against the current published state.

#### 7.4.4 Processing events, distinct from notice lifecycle events

The Notice Event Log records notice lifecycle events. Processing events are distinct from notice lifecycle events and shall be recorded separately, so that governed processing is testable against the notice version relied upon.

A processing event record shall include at minimum:

- processing_event_id
- event_time
- processing_event_type
- notice_version_reference, the notice version relied upon for the processing
- controller_identification_record_id, the accountable controller
- purpose, the recorded purpose relied upon, see 7.5

Note 1 to entry: Separating processing events from notice lifecycle events allows an implementation to demonstrate that recorded processing was governed by a disclosed notice version, and allows a relying party to detect processing that is bound to no notice version and no recorded purpose.

### 7.5 Purpose as a recorded artefact

Purpose shall be recorded, and shall be specified before identification or transfer. Each recorded purpose shall be bound to:

- the legal authority relied upon;
- the controller_identification_record_id of the accountable controller; and
- the notice_version_reference in effect at the time the purpose is disclosed.

NOTE 1: Unrecorded purpose is a security defect, not a documentation omission. Transparency evidence that cannot be inspected after the fact cannot support accountability or enforcement, so the absence of a recorded and bound purpose is a defect in the evidence rather than a missing document. The conformance consequence is stated in clause 8.

NOTE 2: Purpose is carried in the Notice Record for the applicable notice version and is bound to receipts and to processing events through notice_version_reference. Recording purpose as an artefact, rather than as narrative, allows a relying party to test whether processing was bound to a disclosed purpose, controller, and notice version.

### 7.6 Relationship to consent records

Where consent is the lawful basis, the consent statement and the consent record shall reference the prior notice disclosure event, by notice_version_reference and by the applicable Anchored Notice Receipt. This document specifies that reference only. It does not specify consent, the consent statement, or the consent record, which remain governed by ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 and ISO/IEC 29184.

## 8 Mandatory requirements

1. **CIR publication.** The CIR is publicly accessible and resolvable before any demand for personal identification, aligned with 7.1.
2. **Anonymity by default.** No pii_principal_id is required for an Anchored Notice Receipt, aligned with 7.3.1.
3. **Version binding.** Receipts bind to an immutable notice version, and historic versions are retained, aligned with 6.3. Each notice version is represented by a Notice Version Object carrying an integrity hash and a publication time, and the verification procedure in 7.2.4 is supported.
4. **Material change.** A material change creates a new notice version and a corresponding Notice Event Log entry, aligned with 6.3 and 7.4.
5. **Notice classification.** Every receipt populates notice_type using the vocabulary in 7.3.3.
6. **Reciprocal and proportionate disclosure.** The technology and controls disclosure set is published and version bound, aligned with 7.2.1.
7. **Non-exclusion.** At least one privacy_access_point modality is operable without a digital identification credential, aligned with 3.15 and 7.1.3.
8. **Co-regulation conformance.** An implementation asserting co-regulated identification satisfies C1 to C8 in 5.1 for each notice version relied upon.
9. **Purpose recorded.** Purpose is recorded and bound to the legal authority, the controller, and the notice version in effect, aligned with 7.5.
10. **Processing events recorded distinctly.** Processing events are recorded separately from notice lifecycle events, aligned with 7.4.4.
11. **Authorization state carried once.** Where authorization state is relied upon, it is carried by a single Authorization State Object bound to the notice version, state changes are appended rather than overwritten, and the state applying at a stated past time is reconstructable, aligned with 7.2.5.
12. **Schema version stated.** Every receipt carries schema_version with the value specified in 7.3.4, so that a relying party can determine which interpretation rules apply to the record.

## Annex A. Mapping to ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 (informative, except A.0)

This annex provides an interoperability mapping between the base extension artefacts and ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 anchors. Clause references are to ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 as published, not to drafts. Profile field names refer to the fields defined in clause 7. The Action column states the recommended migration or interpretation rule for implementers exchanging records across the TS and this profile.

### A.0 Declared deviation from ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 (normative)

This profile declares one deviation from ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023.

**Deviation.** ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 requires pii_principal_id in the consent record header. This profile does not require it. It substitutes an optional account_id for relationship context, pseudonymous where applicable.

**Rationale.** A required principal identifier makes the evidence artefact unobtainable without identification of the individual, which inverts the sequence this profile specifies. Anonymity by default, see 3.14, is a condition of criterion C3 and of mandatory requirement 2.

**Interoperability consequence.** A record produced under this profile is not, without addition, a conforming TS 27560:2023 consent record where the implementation relies on the required header field. A controller that needs both shall populate account_id, or a TS style pii_principal_id, in the controller side record while keeping the individual side Anchored Notice Receipt free of either. This deviation is stated here so that it is reviewable as a decision rather than discovered as a defect.

All other differences described in this annex are profiling actions, that is constraints, specialisations, or additive extension fields, and are not deviations.

### A.1 Record and receipt header alignment

This profile carries forward TS style schema governance and identifiers through schema_version and the record and receipt identifiers. The treatment of pii_principal_id is stated in A.0.

### A.2 New fields introduced by this profile

| Profile field | Closest TS anchor | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| anchored_notice_receipt | None | Indicator that a receipt instance is the first notice receipt for the applicable disclosure event |
| anchored_notice_receipt_id | None | Linkage field; where the indicator is false or absent, this references the applicable Anchored Notice Receipt |

### A.4 Artefact mapping

| Base extension artefact | Primary purpose | TS 27560:2023 anchor | Notes and deltas |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Controller Identification Record | Controller accountability anchor, controller identification first | Party identification, controller role | Profiled subset of party fields plus required pointers for rights access, event log, and publication |
| Notice Record, versioned | Machine readable notice content and version binding | Consent record context, notice or policy content reference | Adds an explicit immutable notice_version_reference |
| Anchored Notice Receipt | Evidence of disclosure, anonymous by default | Consent receipt, record header and context | Removes the required principal identifier, see A.0; the receipt is version bound |
| Notice Event Log | Lifecycle and material change events | Event and lifecycle elements | Adds minimum event type expectations and an assurance tiering note |

### A.5 CIR mapping

| CIR field | TS 27560:2023 anchor | Change type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| controller_public_id_uri | 6.3.6.5 party_url, closest anchor | Constrained | Public resolvable controller identifier in URI form, profiled as required |
| controller_name | 6.3.6.7 party_name | Constrained | Controller legal name, profiled as required |
| jurisdiction | 6.3.4.17 jurisdiction, PII processing | New | Controller asserted applicable jurisdiction or pointer |
| privacy_access_point | 6.3.6.9 party_contact, closest anchor | Constrained | Structured modalities; at least one operable without a digital identification credential, see 7.1.3 |
| notice_event_log_url | Extension field | New | Pointer to the append only lifecycle record |

### A.6 Notice Event Log mapping

| Event log element | TS 27560:2023 anchor | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| notice_issued | Event type | Disclosure issuance event for a notice version |
| notice_material_change | Event type | Triggers a new notice version and new receipt issuance |
| Assurance tiering note | Conformance guidance | Permits tiered event log requirements with an explicit tier declaration |

## Annex B. Optional profile extensions (normative where stated)

This annex defines two optional profile extensions that build on ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 while preserving the reference integrity and the reciprocal and proportionate transparency requirements of the base extension.

### B.0 Extension discipline

Any record created under an optional profile in this annex:

- shall preserve the base identifiers and version binding, notice_id and notice_version_reference;
- shall not redefine Anchored Notice Receipt semantics; and
- shall reference the Controller Identification Record through controller_identification_record_id.

### B.1 Profile B1, PII processing record structure

**Purpose.** Add a RoPA aligned processing record structure, on the controller and processor side, that is traceable to the disclosed notice versions.

#### B.1.1 Minimum conformance requirements (normative)

A conforming B1 processing record:

- shall include a unique processing_record_id;
- shall include controller_identification_record_id;
- shall include notice_id and notice_version_reference for every disclosed processing fact relied upon;
- shall include lawful_basis using the Annex C vocabulary; and
- should reference Notice Event Log entries where material change, withdrawal, objection, or scope escalation is relevant.

#### B.1.2 Extending the TS with B1

Use ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 as the baseline for party identification in the controller role, profiled into the CIR; for event_time semantics, aligned with the Notice Event Log; and for processing purposes, recipients, and retention, reusing TS field naming where practical, while binding each processing claim to notice_version_reference.

### B.2 Profile B2, personal processing record structure

**Purpose.** Add an individual held, data minimizing personal evidence record that is portable and supports rights exercise.

#### B.2.1 Minimum conformance requirements (normative)

A conforming B2 personal record:

- shall include a unique personal_record_id;
- shall include notice_id and notice_version_reference as the evidence anchor;
- shall include controller_identification_record_id;
- shall include privacy_access_point, or a reference to it through the CIR, sufficient to exercise rights;
- shall support anonymous or pseudonymous operation by default; and
- may include receipt_id as a pointer to a specific receipt instance, accompanied by notice_version_reference.

#### B.2.2 Extending the TS with B2

Treat the TS receipt as the exchange artefact and the B2 record as the individual held wallet architecture. Keep B2 minimal and reference first, with no replication of full processing inventories. Where B2 stores additional detail, that detail should be derived from TS receipt fields, or TS compatible receipt extensions, and should remain unlinkable unless the individual chooses otherwise.

### B.3 Relationship to companion specifications

Cross border security and AI lifecycle governance requirements should be specified in companion documents rather than here:

- Cross border transfer mechanisms: alignment tracked against ISO/IEC 27091 Annex B.4, operational transparency, and ISO/IEC WD 27566-2 Annex F practice statements.
- AI lifecycle governance: alignment tracked against ISO/IEC FDIS 27091 and ISO/IEC 42001.
- Notice and consent record extension work: alignment tracked against ISO/IEC PWI 26689. A clause level crosswalk is required before liaison circulation and is listed as an open item.
- Legal model and vocabulary alignment: expressed in the ANCR DPV Model Extension, which maps the fields specified in clause 7 into DPV terms and anchors them to Convention 108+ Articles 5, 8, 9, and 14. That companion reuses `notice_id`, `notice_version_reference`, `receipt_id`, and the Authorization State Object states specified in 7.2.5 as defined here, rather than minting duplicate terms, and treats this document as the source of the record structure. Where the two documents diverge, this document governs the record structure and the companion governs the vocabulary mapping.

## Annex C. Lawful basis variants, rights and obligations (normative)

This annex defines the lawful basis vocabulary and the minimum rights and obligations disclosure table for lawful basis interoperability. Implementations shall reference the applicable row through lawful_basis in the receipt header.

| lawful_basis | Meaning | Rights commonly triggered | Controller obligations commonly triggered | Minimum header requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| consent | Processing based on meaningful choice by the individual | Withdrawal, access, rectification, erasure where applicable, objection where applicable | Record evidence of consent; enable withdrawal; ensure consent is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous; avoid coercion; demonstrate proof | 2FN may be used; in an online digital identification context, where 2FN is used and no other basis is asserted, online consent is the default interpretation, see 7.2.2; offline consent presented online carries no default, shall be asserted explicitly, and shall be captured in a private controller held record of processing activities; offline and online consent records are named distinctly |
| contract | Processing necessary for contract performance, or for steps taken at the request of the individual | Access, rectification, objection and complaint pathways, portability where applicable | Disclose the necessity scope; limit processing to contract purposes; document retention aligned to the contract | Header shall assert contract and identify the contract purpose scope covered by the notice version |
| legal_obligation | Processing necessary to comply with a legal obligation | Access and explanation, complaint and appeal pathways, restriction where lawful | Identify the obligation authority; document the statutory basis; apply minimization; disclose retention mandates | Header shall assert legal obligation and provide an authority reference or a pointer to it |
| legitimate_interest | Processing necessary for legitimate interests balanced against the rights of the individual | Objection, access, explanation, complaint and appeal pathways | Document the balancing and necessity assessment; provide an objection mechanism; apply safeguards and minimization | Header shall assert legitimate interest and point to the balancing rationale or its summary |
| vital_interest | Processing necessary to protect vital interests | Access and explanation after the fact, where applicable | Document the emergency necessity; limit scope and duration; provide later notice and accountability | Header shall assert vital interest and record the emergency context constraints |
| public_interest | Processing necessary for a task carried out in the public interest or under official authority | Access, explanation, objection and appeal pathways as applicable | Identify the authority; define the task scope; apply proportionality; enable oversight mechanisms | Header shall assert public interest and provide an authority or task reference, or a pointer to it |
| unresolved | No lawful basis was established for the exchange at the time of recording | Access and explanation; objection; complaint pathways as applicable | Resolve the basis, or cease the processing that depends on it; record the unresolved state against the notice version relied upon | Header shall record unresolved, and shall not default to consent, see 7.2.2 |

**Co-regulation note (normative).** The evidence obligation is constant across every row. The lawful basis determines which rights and objection mechanisms apply, and what the controller discloses as authority or justification. It does not determine whether the co-regulation artefacts are required. For every row, a resolvable Controller Identification Record, a versioned Notice Record, an Anchored Notice Receipt, and a Notice Event Log entry shall be available, and the criteria in 5.1 apply unchanged.

NOTE 1: The vocabulary is drawn from Convention 108+ Article 5 and GDPR Article 6. Jurisdictions with a different enumeration require a profiling rule, which is not specified in this version.

NOTE 2: The Convention 108+ DPV style legal model extension cited in 2.2 expresses `consent` and the non consent bases as DPV legal basis classes anchored to Convention 108+ Article 5.2, and models compatibility of further processing separately from legal basis. That mapping is one route to a profiling rule, and it does not change the vocabulary in this table.

## Annex D. Use of the receipt in a four stage exchange (informative)

This annex describes a staged exchange pattern in which a Notice Receipt is used as the evidence architecture across multiple stages. It does not define protocol mechanics.

### D.1 Stage 1, Anchored Notice Receipt, proof of notice

Purpose: establish bilateral evidence that a specific notice version was disclosed or presented, suitable for dispute resolution and, where the lawful basis is consent, for proof of notice supporting valid consent.

Minimum binding identifiers: receipt_id, notice_id, notice_version_reference, controller_identification_record_id, presented_at.

Optional linkage: anchored_notice_receipt set to true.

### D.2 Stage 2, authorization receipt, basis dependent

Purpose: express an authorization state, for example consent, contract acknowledgement, or legal obligation acknowledgement, explicitly linked to the Stage 1 Anchored Notice Receipt.

Interoperability rule: a Stage 2 receipt should reference the Stage 1 receipt using anchored_notice_receipt_id, or reuse receipt_id where a single receipt instance is updated in place.

### D.3 Stage 3, micro credential, protocol facing

Purpose: represent the Stage 2 authorization as a credential or signed assertion suitable for protocol enforcement, for example API or device authorization, without resharing the full receipt content.

Interoperability rule: a Stage 3 credential should carry, or be derivable from, the Stage 1 binding identifiers, controller_identification_record_id with notice_version_reference and receipt_id, so that ambiguity and replay across relying parties are prevented.

### D.4 Stage 4, portable token, portability

Purpose: enable portability and reuse of authorization state across controllers and jurisdictions, subject to scope limits and to revocation or withdrawal controls.

Interoperability rule: a Stage 4 token should be traceable to Stage 1 through the binding identifiers, and should include or reference a status pointer that lets relying parties verify whether the Stage 1 notice version and the Stage 2 authorization remain active.

### D.5 Lifecycle and invalidation

Where staged exchanges are used, implementations should record lifecycle events, including issuance, material change, withdrawal or objection, expiry, and supersession, in the Notice Event Log, so that credentials and tokens derived in Stages 3 and 4 can be invalidated or superseded when the underlying notice or authorization state changes.

## Annex E. TPI-R conformance and compliance profile (informative)

This annex maps the normative artefacts of this document to the Transparency Performance Indicator Report (TPI-R) methodology, for use by an implementer, an auditor, or a regulator assessing a deployed implementation. TPI-R is a measurement tool applied to this specification. It is not a requirement of this document.

### E.1 Purpose

TPI-R is an external assessment methodology that scores how well a live deployment realises the transparency artefacts a standard such as this one specifies. It evaluates four indicators, each independently testable against observable evidence, combined into a composite score:

```text
TPI-R = (TPI-1 x 0.30) + (TPI-2 x 0.25) + (TPI-3 x 0.25) + (TPI-4 x 0.20)
```

The composite produces a rating from glass box, meaning full transparency, to black box, meaning severe non-compliance. A second variant, ANCR TPI-R, extends the four indicators with conformance indicators that test the presence and the integrity of the artefacts this document specifies: the Controller Identification Record, the Notice Receipt, the Anchored Notice Receipt, and the Notice Event Log.

Which variant becomes canonical for this extension is a working group decision, to be recorded here. This annex does not settle TPI-R versions.

### E.2 Indicator mapping

| Indicator | What it measures | Evidence in this document |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TPI-1 Timing | When notice is available relative to identification and processing | Sequence condition in clause 1 and criterion C1; minimum notice disclosure, 3.13 and 7.2.3; presented_at, 7.3.2 |
| TPI-2 Required elements | Whether the required disclosure elements are present | Minimum notice disclosure, 3.13; CIR field set, 7.1.1 and 7.1.2; Notice Receipt fields, 7.3.2; purpose, 7.5 |
| TPI-3 Accessibility | Whether the required information is reachable without obstruction | privacy_access_point, 7.1.3; non-exclusion, 3.15 and criterion C7; publicly retrievable disclosure set, 7.2.1 |
| TPI-4 Security integrity | Whether session security metadata is consistent with the disclosed notice | Notice Version Object and hash verification, 3.24 and 7.2.4; immutability of notice_version_reference, 6.3; Anchored Notice Receipt binding, 3.4 and 7.3; Notice Event Log, 7.4 |
| ANCR: CIR | Presence and resolvability of the CIR | 7.1 and 7.1.2 |
| ANCR: Notice Receipt | Presence of a conforming Notice Receipt | 7.3.2 |
| ANCR: Anchored Notice Receipt | Presence and binding of the Anchored Notice Receipt | 3.4 and 7.3 |
| ANCR: Notice Event Log | Presence of lifecycle event records | 7.4 |

### E.3 Scope boundary

A TPI-R score is a compliance and conformance signal. It is not a conformance claim under this document. A conforming implementation is defined by the mandatory requirements in clause 8 and the conformance criteria in 5.1. TPI-R measures how well a live deployment realises that conformance in practice, which can diverge from the specification text.

### E.4 Attribution

TPI-R is cited by its published methodology name, Transparency Performance Indicator Report, of Kantara Initiative and Digital Transparency Lab origin. The ANCR TPI-R variant referenced here is the Anchored Notice and Consent Receipt profile of that methodology.
